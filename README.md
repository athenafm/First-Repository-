# Research Interests

I am currently completing a Masters in Medical Sciences and conducting research in Pediatric obesity under the supervisor Dr. Katherine Morrison. My research interests align with my Masters program as I enjoy working with children and have a fascination with cardiovascular research. Early diagnosis and prevention are critical in preventing obesity as it can lead to future health complications such as diabetes, stroke, and cardiovascular events. With additional research, this will help to create effective and tailored approaches in treatment plans delivered by physicians. Currently, there is very little known about the genetic influences on pediatric obesity and further inquiry into this field may help to target specific genes and prevent the onset of obesity. I believe this a pressing issue in our society and I am excited to be apart of this research for the next couple of years.

# A Chunk of Code

The goal of First-Repository- is to …

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](README_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub.
