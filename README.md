# My First Repository

## Research Interests

I am currently completing a Masters in Medical Sciences and conducting research in Pediatric obesity under the supervisor Dr. Katherine Morrison. My research interests align with my Masters program as I enjoy working with children and have a fascination with cardiovascular research. Early diagnosis and prevention are critical in preventing obesity as it can lead to future health complications such as diabetes, stroke, and cardiovascular events. With additional research, this will help to create effective and tailored approaches in treatment plans delivered by physicians. Currently, there is very little known about the genetic influences on pediatric obesity and further inquiry into this field may help to target specific genes and prevent the onset of obesity. I believe this a pressing issue in our society and I am excited to be apart of this research for the next couple of years.

The goal of First-Repository- is to â€¦

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

## Project Data Analysis 

**List of Data I have to collect for my thesis project** 
1. Resting energy expenditure in patients undergoing a pharmacological intervention for weight loss (adolescents 12-17 years old diagnosed with obesity)
2. Muscle work efficiency of patients undergoing a pharm intervention or a behavioural lifestyle program
3. Skeletal muscle mass at three different timepoints in the study (at baseline, 6 months and 12 months)

For the data collected above I will be using new datasets by collecting the data myself alongside another research coordinator. I will not be using existing datasets, however the study is based on previous studies that have been conducted in my research lab.

**Legal and ethical restrictions**

Some of the legal and ethical restrictions I must take into account is storing patient data. During each of the study visits, it is important that personal information such as name, phone number, email, medical history is kept privately and only shared between the research investigator and the participant. In order to ensure this is kept securely, personal info such as name will be kept under a serial number to avoid any breach of privacy. Additionally, the data will be stored in a secure place kept under "lock and key" in a file cabinet in which only certain members of the research team have access to. 

**Strategies to protect the value of my data through Quick Hits for Data Management** 

I will be sure to keep the raw data of my project on separate platforms to ensure there are multiple copies. For example, I will keep a copy on Rstudio itself and another copy will be present on Github as well. Additionally, I have a google drive and Onedrive account that is shared with multiple members of my team to ensure they have access and have multiple copies. Lastly, the raw data is also kept on a separate computer that has previous research and data from other studies as well 

Raw data will also be kept in a raw-data folder under my Github repository. I anticipate that the data will be kept in csv files and pdf files, all of wwhich can be converted to open formats. One of the naming conventions that I will use for my project data can be "my-first-project", using dashes to illustrate the spaces in between the words. 

Some of the standards that are relevant to my project involve making sure the particpants fit inside the inclusion and exclusion criteria. For example, to elimiante variability and confounding variables, none of the participants can be pregnant as we do not know the effects of the drug on pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, the participants have to have bloodwork that fits within a certain range, if one of their liver enzymes are too high then this opens up the possibility that some of our results may be not representative of the general population. 

Some of the existing standards that are used in my project is to make sure that the methods that are used to measure energy expenditure are consistent. For example, prior to our metabolic visits, we have to measure body composition using either a DXA scan (gold standard) or a BIA scan. Sometimes, participants cannot fit onto DXA scans so we must use a BIA scan to accomodate them. If it turns out that they lose weight later on in the study using the weight loss drug, we need to use a BIA scanner consistenly throughout the study in order to eliminate variability. A standard that I want to create to help manage my data is to ensure that I am using the same instruments throughout different timepoints in the study. For example, if I use a different tape measurer to obtain waist circumference for one patient, then I must use this throughout the study for that participant to maintain consistency. 

In order to document my data throughout my project I will ensure a Github repository is created so that way I can save my changes and look at the different versions that I have created. This is helpful as it will ensure that I am able to see the progress of my project.
